# Reinforcement learning examples
The examples are presented in the book
['Reinforcement learning'][1] by Sutton and Barto.

## Tic Tac Toe

Currently, the only working example is in the file ttt_new.py.
It requires only numpy and matplotlib and contains an agent learning to beat a
model of an experienced player (see
http://blog.ostermiller.org/tic-tac-toe-strategy for the definition).
